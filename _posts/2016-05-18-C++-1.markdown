First question you may wondering why you would be trying to learn C++, like what's the point? Well I already learned C and I know Java like the back of hand! C++ is like right between C and Java so it just seems like I should pick it up!

But really C++ has a lot of benefits, from what I have heard there are alot of benefits of C++ over C:
 * Static typing
 * Object oriented programming
 * Exception Handling
 * Generic
 * C++ standard library

And furthermore java vs C++ is very well explained here in this lovely wiki article [link] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Java_and_C%2B%2B).

I decided to follow a project-learning process to learn C++. Project-learning process of learning a language or skill by doing a project rather reading books or taking a course. If you ever get stuck you google it! **BUT** don't just copy code from stackoverflow or some other coding forum! A couple of alternatives is to not look at the code answer but rather the explanation and you can look a documentation which really helps to look at. Lastly remember to plan what you want to create!

Creating a project form scratch is very difficult! Some tips I have is:
  * If you are learning a language. Figure out some key features of the language and create a project based on that, so for example if you wanna learn PROLOG, you could work on a AI project like a poker game or something.
  * [1000+ projects] (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2a9ygh/1000_beginner_programming_projects_xpost/)
  * Do something simple like making alarm clock, making a input/output, doing some sorting
  * Look at [project euler dot com] (https://projecteuler.net/) or [beginner projects on Github] (https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.md)

Also always plan your projects because the number killer of great ideas is lack of motivation, trust me I've been there.

Here is my project ideas:
  * Sorting in C++
    * Great for learning the in's and out's of a language
  * Insertion Sorting
  * Merge Sorting
  * Quick Sorting
